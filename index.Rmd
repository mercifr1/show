I am a Distinguished Scientist in Modeling and Simulation at the [Roche Innovation Center in Basel](https://www.roche.ch/en/standorte/basel-hq.htm), in Basel. 

After completion of a Ph.D. in Modeling and Simulation of Biology Systems at ([Univ. Lyon 1](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/en)), I started working in clinical development in 1997. 
Endorsing various roles (data scientist, statistician, pharmacometrician) during  my career, I have had the opportunity to work in different countries (France, Switzerland, USA) and different settings for the pharmaceutical industry: in a small company (Laboratoires Fournier, now [Inventiva](https://inventivapharma.com/)), a CRO specializing in model-based drug development ([Certara](https://www.certara.com/)), and two of the largest pharmaceutical groups ([Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/) and [Roche](https://www.roche.com/)). 

I use semi-mechanistic and statistical models of clinical data to support decision-making in drug development. My research focuses mainly on *dose-finding*, and composite data models such as *joint models*. 

I have also started evaluating the potential of *Bayesian causal inference* and *machine learning*.

So far, I have contributed to 

* 50+ clinical development programs (Phase 1 to Phase 3)

* 4 NDAs (fingolimod, siponimod, ocrelizumab, and entrectinib)

* 50+ scientific articles in statistics and clinical journals

* 60+ posters and 40+ oral communications in statistics and pharmacometrics conferences.
