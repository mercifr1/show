My research focuses mainly on dose-finding, and composite data models such as joint models. I have also started evaluating the potential and challenges of Bayesian causal inference and machine learning.\r\nI work on projects in oncology solid tumors (NSCLC, UBC, HCC, RCC, OvC) and neurosciences (Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease).\r\nEducation\r\nPh. D. University Lyon 1, Applied Mathematics, 1997.\r\nM. Sc. University Lyon 1, Biomathematics, 1993.\r\nB. Sc. University Lyon 1, Biology, 1991.\r\nExperience (in recent years)\r\nRoche-Genentech - Basel, 2014-Present \r\nPROJECTS\r\nProject Lead Statistician in early oncology clinical development for the PD1-IL2v (2019-2023), TYRP1-TCB (2020-2023), MAP4K1 (2021-2022) and CEACAM5-TCB (2019-2020) projects; Supported the definition of the clinical development plan, study designs, and delivered statistical analyses to support decision-making.\r\nLead Modeler for the entrectinib project, in both ROS1 lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and NTRK fusion positive (tumor agnostic) patients (2018-2019); in particular extrapolation of the dose in children (based on body surface area) supported by population PK modeling done in adults. Filing in Dec-2018 in USA and Japan, and Jan-2019 in EU.\r\nLead Modeler for the ocrelizumab project, in both relapsing (RMS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) (2014-2017); in particular extrapolation of the dose in PPMS supported by population PKPD modeling done in RMS patients. Filing in 2016 and approval in USA (BLA 761053) and EU (EMA Assessment Report 790835) in 2017.\r\nLEADERSHIP\r\nCausal inference in pharmacometrics (2023-…): Principal Investigator in a cross-industry working group evaluating how the renewed interest in causal inference may impact pharmacometrics.\r\nEstimands in early oncology clinical development (2021-2023): Principal Investigator in the EDEN working group, a task force of the oncoestimand cross-industry effort. We developed to recommendations for the handling of intercurrent events in Phase 1a adaptive trials evaluating drug toxicity using DLT, and in Phase 1b/2 trials evaluating efficacy on the basis of ORR. In a separate task force, I also contributed to a reflection on estimand for the evaluation of duration of response.\r\nPharmacometrics section leader (2014-2019): Team leader for a group of 5 pharmacometricians. Technical oversight of all agreed modeling activities. Recruit, retain, train and develop staff within the Clinical Pharmacometrics group.\r\nWORKSTREAMS CONTRIBUTOR\r\nDose and schedule optimization (2020-2022): Definition and identification of the “right” dosing regimen has often been expedited in oncology solid tumor, resulting - in some case - in post-approval requirement for sponsors to prove that the marketed dose was “fair”. In this work stream, we defined minimum requirements for oncology clinical development plans to deliver the “right” dosing regimen.\r\nModel-based bio-equivalence (2016-2022): In case of sample study (e.g. in pediatric indication) and/or sparse PK sampling, it might be difficult to assess PK bioequivalence (BE). In this joint industry-FDA-academic effort, model-based BE evaluation is considered, and the operating characteristics are assessed.\r\nMentoring (in recent years)\r\nAnna Fochesato - postdoc at Roche (2023-2025)\r\nGeorgios Kazantzidis (U. Zurich, Switzerland) - Ph.D. at Roche (2023-2026)\r\nYannik Amman (U. Zurich, Switzerland) - M.Sc. internship at Roche (2023)\r\nMarion Kerioui (U. Paris, France) - Ph.D. at Roche (2019-2022)\r\nIulia-Maia Muresan (U. Geneva, Switzerland) - M.Sc. internship at Roche (2022)\r\nAthena Sheppard (U. Leicester, UK) - M.Sc. internship at Roche (2022)\r\nMarine Pillet (U. Bordeaux, France) - M.Sc. internship at Roche (2019)\r\nSandrine Brice (ENSAI, France) - M.Sc. internship at Roche (2017)\r\nOther professional activities\r\nReviewer for: Pharmaceutical Statistics, Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics, Statistics in Medicine, CPT: Pharmacometrics and Systems Pharmacology, AAPS Journal.\r\nWorkshops and Conferences attended at least three times:\r\nAnnual conference of the International Society of Clinical Biostatistics (ISCB)\r\nPopulation Approach Group in Europe (PAGE) meeting\r\nMembership to professional associations:\r\n2022-now International Society of Bayesian Analysis (ISBA)\r\n2016-now International Society of Pharmacometrics (ISoP)\r\n2008-now International Society of Clinical Biostatistics (ISCB)\r\n1999-2008 Société Française de Statistique – Groupe Biopharmacie et Santé (SFdS)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
